<p class="center">(<i>Letter from a Lady.</i>)</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width:50%;"> <a href="images/043.png"><img width="100%" src="images/043.png" alt="" /></a></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Mr. Punch</span>,</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Though</span> you love to laugh, and we all love to laugh with
you, I know that you are kindness itself when an afflicted woman
throws herself upon your sympathy. This letter will not be quite
so short as I could wish; but, unless you have my whole story, you
will not understand my sorrow.</p>

<p class="indent">My boy, <span class="smcap">Johnny</span>, is one of the dearest boys you can imagine. I
send you his photograph, though it does not half justice to the
sweetness and intelligence of his features; besides, on the day it was
taken, he had a cold, and his hair had not been properly cut, and
the photographer was very impatient, and after eight or nine sittings,
he insisted that I ought to be satisfied. I could tell you a hundred
anecdotes of my boy's cleverness, but three or four, perhaps, will be
enough.</p>

<blockquote>
[<i>More than enough, dear Madam. We proceed to the paragraph
that follows them.</i>]
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">His father, I regret to say, though a kind parent, does not see in
<span class="smcap">Johnny</span> the talent and genius which I am certain he possesses. The
child, who is eleven years and eleven months old, goes (alas, I must
say went) to a Private Academy of the most respectable description.
Only twelve young gentlemen are taken, and the terms are about
£100 a-year, and most things extra. The manners of the pupils are
strictly looked after; they have no coarse amusements; and, to see
them neatly dressed, going arm-in-arm, two and two, for a walk,
was quite delightful. I shall never see them again without tears.</p>

<p class="indent">My husband was desirous that <span class="smcap">Johnny</span> should have a sound classical
education, and we believed&mdash;I believe still&mdash;that this is given at
the Private School in question. One evening during the holidays, my
husband asked <span class="smcap">Johnny</span> what Latin Book he was reading. The child
replied, without hesitation or thought&mdash;&quot;<i>Horace</i>.&quot; &quot;Very good,&quot;
said his father, taking down the odious book. &quot;Let you and me
have a little go-in at <i>Horace</i>.&quot; I went to my desk, <i>Mr. Punch</i>, and,
as I write very fast, I resolved to make notes of what occurred, for I
felt that <span class="smcap">Johnny</span> would cover himself with glory and honour. <i>This</i>
is what occurred. Of course, I filled in the horrid Latin, afterwards,
from the book, which I could gladly have burned.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Papa.</i> Well, let us see, my boy, suppose we take Hymn number
xiv. You know all about that? <i>Ad Rempublicam.</i> What does that
mean?</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Johnny.</i> O, we never learn the titles.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Papa.</i> Pity, because they help you to the meaning. But come,
what's <i>Rempublicam</i>?</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Johnny.</i> I suppose it means a public thing. <i>Rem's</i> a thing, and
<i>publicus</i> is public. [Was not that clever in the dear fellow, putting
words together like that, <i>Mr. Punch</i>? Will you believe it, his Papa
did nothing but give him a grunt?]</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Papa.</i> Go on.</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p><i>O navis, referent in mare te novi</i></p>
<p><i>Fluctus. O quid agis?</i></p>
</div>

<p class="indent"><i>Johnny.</i></p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>O, navy, referring to the sea. I have known thee.</p>
<p>What will the waves do?</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">[I thought this quite beautiful, like &quot;<i>What are the Wild Waves
Saying?</i>&quot;]</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Papa.</i> Ah! Proceed.</p>

<p class="i2">&mdash;&mdash;<i>fortiter occupa</i></p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>Bravely occupy the door.</p>
<p>You see a nun.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent"><i>Papa.</i> A nun, child. What do you mean?</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Johnny.</i> A nun is a holy but mistaken woman, Papa, that lives in
a monastery, and worships graven images. [You see he had been
<i>beautifully</i> taught.]</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Papa.</i> But what word, in the name of anachronisms, do you
make a nun?</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Johnny.</i> <i>Nonne.</i> O, I forgot, Pa, that's French. [Instead of being
pleased that the child knew three languages instead of two, his
Papa burst out laughing.]</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Papa.</i> Try this:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p><i>Et malus celeri saucius Africo,</i></p>

<p class="indent"><i>Johnny.</i></p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>And celery sauce is bad for an African,</p>
<p>And your aunts groan though there is no funeral,</p>
<p class="i2">And they could not be more imperious</p>
<p class="i2">If they had to endure a sea-voyage.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent"><i>Myself.</i> Darling! Why don't you say something to encourage
him, <span class="smcap">Tom</span>? It's delightful.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Papa.</i> Yes, it's encouraging. Go on, Sir.</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i2">&mdash;&mdash;<i>non tibi sunt integra lintea;</i></p>
<p><i>Non di, quos iterum pressa voces malo.</i></p>

<div class="poem">

<p>You have no large pieces of lint.</p>
<p>Do not die, though they again press you to say apple.</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p><i>Nil pictis timidus navita puppibus</i></p>
<p><i>Fidit!</i></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent"><i>Johnny.</i> No sailor is frightened at the dogs in a picture he sees.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Papa.</i> <i>Fidit's</i>, he sees, eh?</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i2">&mdash;&mdash;<i>Tu, nisi ventis</i></p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>If it wasn't for the wind,</p>
<p>You ought to play in a cave.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent"><i>Papa.</i> Ha! Well, here's the last; we may as well go through it.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Myself.</i> Papa! don't be so cross.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Papa.</i> Mind your letter-writing, will you? [But <i>I wasn't</i> letter-writing.
I was making notes.]</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="indent"><i>Nuper sollicitum quæ mihi tædium.</i>
</p></div>
</div>

<p class="indent"><i>Johnny.</i> Lately a solicitor was a great bore to me.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Papa.</i> [To do him justice, he recovered his good-humour and
roared.]</p>

<p class="indent">A great bore, was he? They <i>are</i> bores sometimes. Now
then&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="indent"><i>Nunc desiderium, curaque non levis.</i>
</p></div>
</div>

<p class="indent"><i>Johnny.</i> I do not care for the light of the stars.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Papa.</i> Hang it, <span class="smcap">Johnny</span>, how do you get at &quot;stars&quot; in that line?</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Johnny.</i> <i>De</i>, of, <i>siderium</i>, dative, no, genitive plural of <i>sidus</i>, a
star, Papa, and <i>levis</i> is light.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Papa.</i> Finish.</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p><i>Interfusa nitentes</i></p>
<p><i>Vites æquora Cycladas.</i></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">What do you make of that? &quot;With an infusion of nitre the
vines are equal to Cyclops&quot;&mdash;is that it?</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Johnny.</i> I think so, Papa dear. The Cyclops were great giants,
who poked out the eye of Achilles with a hot stick, for throwing
stones at their ship.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Papa.</i> Go to bed!</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Johnny.</i> What for, Papa?</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Myself.</i> Yes, what for, <span class="smcap">Tom</span>? I'm sure the dear fellow has done
his best to please you.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Papa.</i> You are right. It is I who ought to be sent to bed. All
right, <span class="smcap">Johnny</span>. Let us have a game at the <i>Battle of Dorking</i>&mdash;get
the board. That's good fun. But £100 a-year, and <i>sollicitum</i>, a solicitor,
isn't. However, we'll alter that.</p>

<p class="indent">And, dear <i>Mr. Punch</i>, he gave notice the very next day that
<span class="smcap">Johnny</span> should not go back to the Private School, and is going to send
him to a College, to be starved, fagged, beaten, knocked down with
cricket-balls, trampled down at football, and taught to fight.</p>

<h2>True Thomas of Chelsea.</h2>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">It</span> was <span class="smcap">Mr. Carlyle</span> who first revealed the existence of Phantasm
Captains, which many people refused to believe in, and laughed at
the notion of. What do they say now that a Board of Captains in
command over Captains and Admirals too is called by its own
Secretary a Phantom Board? Surely that <span class="smcap">Thomas</span> of Chelsea is a
true Seer, and long since saw through Simulacra which have, in
truth, at last been discovered to be transparent Shams.</p>

<h3>&quot;THE OLD CLOCK ON THE STARE.&quot;</h3>
</div>

<hr />

<h2>EVENINGS FROM HOME.</h2>

<p class="indent"><i><span class="smcap">Mr. Barlow</span>, with <span class="smcap">Masters Harry Sandford</span> and <span class="smcap">Tommy Merton</span>,
visits <span class="smcap">Astley's Theatre</span>, to see the Pantomime of &quot;<span class="smcap">Lady Godiva</span>.&quot;</i></p>

<p class="indent">&quot;<span class="smcap">This</span>,&quot; exclaimed <span class="smcap">Harry</span>, &quot;is an exhibition which affords me,
and indeed appears to give to a vast number besides myself, the
greatest gratification.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Tommy.</i> I see, Sir, that <i>St. George</i> appears in this story with
<i>Lady Godiva</i>; pray, Sir, who was <i>St. George</i>?</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Mr. Barlow.</i> There have been, my dear <span class="smcap">Tommy</span>, various opinions
on this interesting subject, and some honest folks have sought to
identify the celebrated personage in question with a Butcher, who
served bad meat to the Christians in Palestine, while others have
gone equally far towards proving that he was no Butcher, but an
Arian Bishop of Alexandria. Whether Butcher, or Bishop, it was for
a long time most difficult to determine.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Harry.</i> But pray, Sir, why did not the antagonistic parties bring
the case into a Court of Law so as to obtain a decision.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Mr. Barlow.</i> Your own experience, <span class="smcap">Harry</span>, will, doubtless, one
of these days furnish you with sufficient reason for the persons
interested not having given employment to the gentlemen of the
long robe. There was no claimant to the title living, and there was
nothing beyond a title to be claimed; for, whether on the one hand
(with <span class="smcap">Eusebius</span>) revering him as a Saint, or, on the other (with
<span class="smcap">Gibbon</span>) abusing him as &quot;the infamous <span class="smcap">George</span>,&quot; both sides
admitted the object of their contention to have been long since
deceased. He is, however, the patron Saint of England, and owes
his great reputation in modern times to managers of Theatres at
Christmas, and writers of extravaganzas and of Pantomimes, to
whom his history is invaluable, as affording marvellous opportunities
for great scenic display, and spectacular effect, while the Saintly
Knight himself seldom fails to find an admirable representative in
either a young lady of considerable personal attractions (as here at
<span class="smcap">Astley's</span>) or in some eccentric and grotesque gentleman like one of
the lithsome <span class="smcap">Paynes</span>, or the agile <span class="smcap">Mr. Vokes</span>, whose extraordinary
feats, with his legs, we have already witnessed at Drury Lane
Theatre. I confess, however, that I do not perceive by what process
<i>St. George</i> has been brought into the comparatively modern
legend of <i>Lady Godiva</i>.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Harry.</i> It seems to me, Sir, that you intended us just now to
remark some diverting jest in your use of the words &quot;feats&quot; and
&quot;legs,&quot; which <span class="smcap">Tommy</span>, I fear, has failed to comprehend.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Mr. Barlow.</i> Indeed, <span class="smcap">Harry</span>, you are quite right, and I trust
that both you, and <span class="smcap">Tommy</span>, will be able to utter such pleasantries
yourselves with a full appreciation of their value. I regret to notice
that <span class="smcap">Miss Sheridan</span>, who, with much discretion, performs the part
of the <i>Lady Godiva</i>, is suffering from cold, and is, consequently, a
little hoarse. This is natural at <span class="smcap">Astley's</span>.</p>

<p class="indent">Then, turning to <span class="smcap">Tommy</span>, and smiling in his usual kind manner,
<span class="smcap">Mr. Barlow</span> said, &quot;My dear <span class="smcap">Tommy</span>, although you have not yet
mastered the amusing puns which I made in my recent discourse,
you can, it may be, tell me why <span class="smcap">Miss Sheridan</span> resembles a pony?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Tommy</span>, whose whole attention was now given to the scene,
expressed his intention of at once renouncing all attempts at solving
this problem. Whereupon <span class="smcap">Mr. Barlow</span> cheerfully replied that
<span class="smcap">Miss Sheridan</span> so far resembled a pony, inasmuch as she was,
unfortunately, on that evening, &quot;a little hoarse.&quot; <span class="smcap">Harry</span> laughed at
this sally, and, indeed, considered his beloved tutor a prodigy of wit
and ingenuity; but it was otherwise with <span class="smcap">Tommy</span>, who remained
silent and depressed during the greater part of the entertainment;
and, indeed, it was not until the very effective Transformation
Scene that <span class="smcap">Tommy's</span> unbounded pleasure and admiration once more
found vent in the most unqualified applause, in which the entire
audience joined.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Harry.</i> These expressions of delight remind me of the story you
read to me the other day, Sir, called <i>Agesiläus and the Elastic
Nobleman</i>. As <span class="smcap">Tommy</span> has not heard it I will&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">But at this moment a vast assemblage of children on the stage,
habited as soldiers, commenced the National Anthem at the top of
their voices, which for the time put an end to further conversation.</p>

<p class="indent">On quitting the theatre, <span class="smcap">Tommy</span>, who from having been in a state
of the greatest elation had once more resumed the sober and saddened
aspect with which he had listened to his tutor's discourse
during the play, took <span class="smcap">Harry</span> aside, and declared to him, with
tears in his eyes, that from that day forward he would never rest
till he had made himself thoroughly acquainted with all the jokes
in the English language, and had perfected himself in the art of
constructing new ones.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Your determination, <span class="smcap">Master Tommy</span>,&quot; replied his young friend,
&quot;reminds me of the story of <i>Darius and the Corrugated Butcher</i>;
but, as I am too fatigued to-night to remember its main features, I
will defer the recital of it till to-morrow morning.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Tommy</span> evinced a great curiosity to know whether there were in
this tale any puns, upon which he might at once exercise his
intelligence, but on <span class="smcap">Harry's</span> repeating his promise, he allowed him
to go to bed without further question.</p>

<p class="indent">Being thus left to his own resources, <span class="smcap">Tommy Merton</span>, in pursuance
of his new resolution, went to the book-shelves and commenced
a search which was not destined to be altogether fruitless.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Mr. Barlow</span> had scarcely been in bed two hours, when he was
aroused from a most peaceful and refreshing slumber by a loud
hammering and knocking at the door of his chamber. Unable to
imagine what had happened, and, indeed, fearing lest the premises
should have unfortunately caught fire, he was on the point of
gathering together such articles of clothing as he considered strictly
necessary, when <span class="smcap">Tommy</span> burst into the room half-undressed, and
bawling out, &quot;I've seen it! I've seen it!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What have you seen?&quot; asked <span class="smcap">Mr. Barlow</span>.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why, Sir,&quot; answered <span class="smcap">Tommy</span>, &quot;I had a mind to discover, before
I went to bed, what you meant by your two jokes at Astley's. So,
Sir, I got down your book of <i>Joseph Miller's Jests</i>, a dictionary, and
a grammar; and I find that the fun you had intended lies in the
similarity of pronunciation in the case of the substantive <i>horse</i> and
of the adjective <i>hoarse</i>, and also in <i>feat</i> and <i>feet</i> possessing a like
sound.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well,&quot; said <span class="smcap">Mr. Barlow</span>, pausing, with a boot-jack in hand,
&quot;you are indeed right. And if you will approach a little nearer&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">But <span class="smcap">Tommy</span>, anticipating the purport of his revered tutor's invitation,
had speedily withdrawn himself from the apartment, being
careful at the same time to lock <span class="smcap">Mr. Barlow's</span> door on the outside.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;To-morrow,&quot; said <span class="smcap">Mr. Barlow</span> quietly to himself as he returned
to his bed&mdash;&quot;To-morrow we will talk over these things.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He now perceived that he was in a condition of unwonted restlessness;
and it was not until he had twice repeated to himself the story
of <i>The Laplander and the Agreeable Peacock</i>, that he fell asleep.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Doctors in Court.</h2>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Medical</span> men, experts and others, in the witness-box, are unfortunately
apt to use technical terms for which there are no equivalents
in plain English. For this pedantry the Judge usually snubs
them. Quite right. There are no hard words or phrases, of which
the use, by Judges or Counsel, is sometimes unavoidable, in Law.</p>

<h2>OWLS THAT IS NOT HORGANS.</h2>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Mr. Punch</span> has&mdash;need he say it?&mdash;the
profoundest admiration for the skill and
zeal of the great Healers who have conducted
H.R.H. the <span class="smcap">Prince of Wales</span>
out of the region of bulletins. But he
hopes that should any member of the
Royal Family again need medical advice
(which good fortune forefend for
many a long day), no name belonging to
a member of the illustrious trio may be
signed to the <i>affiches</i>. It was not for
<i>Mr. Punch</i> to complain while bulletins
issued, but now all else is happiness, he
makes his moan, or rather (as <span class="smcap">Mr. Roebuck</span>
says Birmingham is always doing)
makes his howl. How many thousand
idiots have sent <i>Mr. Punch</i> jests on the
names of the Doctors, he cannot say, but
the changes have been rung, <i>ad nauseam</i>,
on a &quot;Jennerous diet,&quot; a &quot;Lowe fever,&quot;
a &quot;bird of good omen&mdash;a Gull,&quot; until&mdash;&mdash;But
not one goose was gratified; ha! ha! Fire, not vanity,
was fed. Still, <i>Mr. Punch</i> has suffered; and therefore he begs
leave to suggest that all the three Doctors be raised to the Peerage.
They have richly deserved it, and so has <span class="smcap">Sir James Paget</span> (whose
name happily does not help the small wits); but <i>Mr. Punch's</i>
comfort is the thing to be considered. N.B. He likes to give those
who are &quot;blest in not being simple men&quot; an occasional peep&mdash;as
thus&mdash;at the circumjacent world of donkeyism.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Malaprop</span> has lately been studying Latin, with success.

<h2>GUILDED LADIES.</h2>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Ladies</span>, look at this proposal to promote
what some of you may call the
millineryennium:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
&quot;A Guild of Ladies is proposed to be formed
to promote modesty of dress to do away with
extravagance, and substitute the neatness and
sobriety suitable to Christian women.&quot;
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">A guild formed to promote the sobriety
of women ought to have <span class="smcap">Sir Wilfrid
Lawson</span> for a patron, and should be
supported by every Teetotaller now
living in the land. But the sobriety
here mentioned is that of dress, not
drink; and total abstinence from finery
and flummery of fashion is doubtless
the chief aim of the promoters of the
guild. Well, if they succeed in reducing
even chignons to reasonable
dimensions, they will deserve the thanks
of every one afflicted with good taste; and
if they further are successful in reducing
the enormous bills which ladies owe their milliners, they will earn the
heartfelt gratitude of many a poor husband, who can ill afford to
pay them. All is not gold that glitters, but we may guess there is
true metal, and not merely specious glitter, in these Guilded Ladies.</p>

<h2>French and British Budgets.</h2>

<p class="indent">M. <span class="smcap">Thiers</span> has been censured by some of our contemporaries for
his fiscal policy of seeking to impose heavy duties on raw materials.
At any rate, however, France will not be saddled (like an ass) with
an Income-tax; so the taxation to which that country will be subjected,
will be comparatively light, even if it should have the effect of
making butchers' meat as frightfully dear there as it is in England.</p>

<h2>A TEMPERANCE HOSPITAL.</h2>

<div class="figleft" style="width:30%;"> <a href="images/046.png"><img width="100%" src="images/046.png" title="G" alt="G" /></a></div>

<p><span class="smcap">o</span> to! The anti-alcoholic manifesto
lately put
forth by the two
hundred and fifty
first-class Doctors
is already producing
the effect
which a demonstration,
fortified
with names some
having handles to
them, seldom fails
to produce on a
portion of the
generally intelligent
British Public.
It has caused
&quot;a movement.&quot;
The <i>Daily News</i>
announces that:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
&quot;A movement has
been started to establish
a hospital in
London 'for the
treatment of diseases
apart from the ordinary
administration
of alcoholic
liquors.'&quot;
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">The object of
the  movement
does not appear
from the words in which it is stated quite so clearly as the thinking
persons who may attach importance to it must desire. Do not, in
fact, most Doctors, as it is, treat diseases &quot;apart from the ordinary
administration of alcoholic liquors?&quot; Are not all patients but those
labouring under diseases of debility, as a rule, enjoined by their
medical attendant to abstain, totally or comparatively, from wine,
beer, and spirits? In hospitals, where this abstinence can always be
enforced, the treatment of diseases apart from the ordinary administration
of alcoholic liquors is especially usual. Do the enlightened
promoters of a movement for the establishment of a hospital, whereat
diseases shall be so treated still more especially, mean to say that, in
that new institution alcohol, in diseases in which it has hitherto been
wont to be ordinarily administered as a tonic or stimulant requisite
for their cure, shall not be given&mdash;and if so, why? Because alcohol
is a poison? Then why stop at alcohol? Why not also proscribe,
instead of prescribing, opium, henbane, hemlock, deadly nightshade,
arsenic, and prussic acid; and indeed&mdash;for what active medicine
is not a poison in an over-dose?&mdash;nearly every article in the
<i>Materia Medica</i>?</p>

<p class="indent">Truly the great Two-Hundred-and-Fifty Against Alcohol, themselves
even, leave some room for question as to their meaning when
they proclaim that &quot;it is believed that the inconsiderate prescription
of large quantities of alcoholic liquids by Medical Men for their
patients has given rise, in many instances, to the formation of intemperate
habits.&quot; Believed by, and of whom? By the Two-Hundred-and-Fifty
Doctors of their Profession at large, or by
Society in general of it, including them? One would like to know
who the believers are, in order to be enabled to appraise the belief,
and it would also please one to be informed whether or no the belief
includes a confession, which the Two-Hundred-and-Fifty make for
themselves. Did you, gentle reader, in the course of your experience,
ever happen to meet with a victim of the Bottle who dated his
intemperance from taking port wine or brandy, prescribed for him
when convalescent, for example, from typhus fever?</p>

<p class="indent">One can indeed understand and appreciate the advice that
&quot;alcohol, in whatever form, should be prescribed and administered
with as much care as any powerful drug,&quot; and peradventure this will
create another movement, a movement of a speculative nature, for
the manufacture of graduated physic glasses, of various sizes, to
replace the sherry, champagne, hock, and claret glasses now in use
at table: a minim-glass to be the new glass for liqueurs and brandy.
This practical improvement in Social Science may be shortly introduced
by some of our leading medical men at their own tables.
And when they exhibit alcohol, in whatever form, perhaps, in
future, they will always take care to combine it with something
very nauseous; gin, for instance, with the most horrible of bitters.
This will effectually prevent the administration of alcohol from
originating the formation of intemperate habits.</p>

<p class="indent">Doubtless, on the whole, the Two-Hundred-and-Fifty have spoken
wisely; but the echo of their speech in some quarters has sounded
like cackle, and the &quot;movement,&quot; which their utterance has set on
foot among gregarious persons, very much resembles the march of
an analogous kind of birds, under leadership, across a common.</p>

<h2>RURAL INTELLIGENCE.</h2>

<p class="center">SPLICINGHAM.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Interesting Event.</span>&mdash;On Thursday the 25th inst. this pretty
little village was early astir, and thrown into a state of pleasurable
excitement, it being the nuptial morn of <span class="smcap">Miss Selina Sunnismile</span>,
daughter of <span class="smcap">Mr. Sunnismile</span>, gardener and florist, with <span class="smcap">Mr. Robert
Grubbins</span>, pork-butcher, both of this parish. The parents of the
happy couple being held in high esteem, triumphal arches were
erected, decked with appropriate mottoes, and the front of the
bride's residence was festooned with early cauliflowers and other
floral ornaments which her father had purveyed. The choral service
terminated with the <i>Wedding March</i> of <span class="smcap">Mendelssohn</span>, performed
on the harmonium by <span class="smcap">Mr. Joseph Thumper</span> with his accustomed
skill. An elegant <i>déjeûner</i>, consisting of pork-pies, pickled herrings,
trotters, tripe, and wedding-cake, was then done ample justice to
by a select party of guests; the bride's health being drunk in
bumpers of champagne, expressly made for the occasion from her
father's famous gooseberries, which gained a prize last summer at
the exhibition of the Splicingham Pomological Society. After this
affecting ceremony, the happy pair departed, in a shower of old
slippers, on a trip to the metropolis, to spend their honeymoon.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">ind</span> <i>Mr. Punch</i>, a happy
change has come over the
character of our Public
Schools. The chief of them,
I have been told, of what
is called mediæval foundation,
were originally intended
to educate the sons
of poor gentlemen. But
now, Sir, the purpose they
have come to serve is just
the reverse of that. A correspondent
of the <i>Morning
Post</i>, signing himself <span class="smcap">Pavidus</span>&mdash;evidently
a mean,
shabby, needy sprig of gentility,
afraid, as his signature
means, if I am not
misinformed, which, by
the tenor of his letter, he
plainly confesses himself
to be, of having to fork
out more than he is able&mdash;writes
to complain, forsooth,
of &quot;the growing
abuse of 'tips' and pocket-money
allowance.&quot; This
contemptible indigent fellow
says:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
&quot;It is within my knowledge
that at one of the chief public
schools&mdash;and I am told that the
same rule holds good at the
other schools of this class&mdash;a
boy who does not bring back £5 each half is set down by 'the house' as a
'duffer' and as of 'no use.' In other words, he is under the cold shade of
his fellow-boarders, and is subject to constant and galling humiliation.&quot;
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">Very well. Let him be off, then. A first-class Public School is
no place for him any more than a first-class carriage. Let the
beggar who doesn't like it, leave it&mdash;go second or third class, and be
taught the three R's under <span class="smcap">Forster's</span> Education Act. But now
read what <span class="smcap">Pavidus</span> has the insolence to say further:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
&quot;It is not every lad that can bear lightly the gibes and jeers of the young
cotton lords whose home ethics teach them to measure the quality of a gentleman
by the amount of money he can spend. The result is inevitable. The
'soc' shop gives credit. A loan is soon and easily contracted, and the boy,
smarting under the results of his comparative poverty, begins his career of
debt and deceit in order to hold his own among his more pecunious fellows.&quot;
</blockquote>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Mr. Pavidus</span>, in his pride and poverty, seems very indignant at
the idea of wealthy young cotton lords treating poor young pedigree
lords with contempt. I dare say he is some poor nobleman's relation
himself, the <span class="smcap">Honourable Pavidus</span>, perhaps, or <span class="smcap">Right Honourable
Pavidus</span>.</p>

<p class="indent">When he wrote the above sneer at cotton lords probably he
turned up his nose. That is, I mean, he tried to, for it is a nose
that don't turn up by nature, I'm sure. I'll be bound it's one of
those aquiline hook-noses which your bloated aristocrats are so vain
of, none of your jolly button-mushroom snub. I fancy I see
<span class="smcap">Pavidus&mdash;Lord Pavidus</span>, perhaps&mdash;looking down upon myself and
sniffing at me, like a footman with too strong a bouquet in his
buttonhole. He and his, and such as they, had best keep themselves
to themselves. If our boys are too well-off at school for theirs,
and yet theirs are above being sent to regular pauper schools, why
don't your Nobs and Swells get up poor's schools of their own, poor
gentlemen's schools, if they like to call them so? At such schools
the rule might be that no boy was to come from home to school with
more than five shillings in his pocket, nor be allowed above sixpence
a week.</p>

<p class="indent">Dress and board could be cut down to the same plain, poverty-stricken
scale. Such regulations would keep the high-bred paupers
what they call select enough without any necessity, which they
that pride themselves so on their pronunciation might perhaps
imagine, for an entrance examination to try if new-comers could
pronounce their h's. And so, poor nobility and gentry, being brought
up in that frugal sort of way, would continue in it, because able to
afford no better, and by-and-by, I dare say, get to pride themselves
upon it, and make a merit and a boast of their despicable economy;
so that plain living and dressing and eating and drinking will some
day perhaps be considered the particular tokens of high birth and
breeding, and of class-distinction between <span class="smcap">Plantagenet Mowbray
Fitz-Montague Norfolk Howard</span> and</p>

<h2>TICHBORNE <i>V.</i> LUSHINGTON.</h2>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Boyle's</span> <i>Court Guide</i> is, as all who dwell or have friends in the
Court District know, as accurate and convenient a book of reference
as possible. No library table can be without this manual. It is
with great reluctance, therefore, that <i>Mr. Punch</i>, in the exercise of
stern duty, devotes the new volume of the <i>Guide</i> to the vengeance
of <span class="smcap">Lord Chief Justice Bovill</span>. But respect for the Bench compels
<i>Mr. Punch</i> to offer this sacrifice. In the issue for January, 1872,
on page 797, this may be read:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
&quot;<span class="smcap">Tichborne, Sir Roger C. D.</span>, <i>Bart.</i>, 10, Harley Road West, Brompton,
S.W.&quot;
</blockquote>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Now</span> <i>Mr. Punch</i> appeals to the <span class="smcap">Lord Chief Justice</span>, and to the
Universe to say whether the desire expressed by the former that
there should be no comment on the Tichborne case, <i>pendente lite</i>,
has not been scrupulously complied with. Dull as the season has
been, there has been no yielding to the temptation to make smart
articles out of the Australian Romance. <i>Mr. Punch</i> himself, who
is above all laws, has set the most noble example to his contemporaries,
and even when he has borrowed an illustration from the big
trial, he has carefully avoided any expression of opinion as to the
merits. But, in the <i>Court Guide</i>, the Claimant, or somebody else,
has inserted an entry which prejudges the case. The name and title
of <span class="smcap">Sir Roger Tichborne</span> are claimed as calmly as if the ownership
were as well established as that of the name and title of <span class="smcap">Sir William
Bovill</span>, which appear in another page, or as <i>Mr. Punch's</i> own
name and title would be cited, but that it pleases him to occupy his
family mansion East of Temple Bar. This is Contempt of Court.
The Attorney-General has stated his belief that the Claimant is a
cunning and audacious conspirator, a perjurer, a forger, an impostor,
and a villain. He may be all these things, and not <span class="smcap">Sir Roger
Tichborne</span>. He may be none of these things, and be <span class="smcap">Sir Roger
Tichborne</span>. He may be only so many of these things as are compatible
with his being <span class="smcap">Sir Roger Tichborne</span>. No person, except
an advocate, has the least right to state an opinion until the jury
shall be finally locked up, and out of the way of being prejudiced.
Whoever took on himself to decide the case, by sending to the <i>Court
Guide</i> a statement that <span class="smcap">Sir Roger Tichborne</span> exists, and resides at
the above address, did that for which he should be called on to
answer at the bar of the Common Pleas. Roo-ey, too-ey, too-ey-too-ey
too!</p>

<h2>LIQUOR LAWS SUPERSEDED.</h2>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Mouthing</span>, spouting, declamatory, meddlesome agitation for the
compulsory enforcement of total abstinence from invigorating, comforting,
cheering, and restorative drinks on people to whom it would
be intolerable, is the very staff of life to the United Kingdom Alliance.
Therefore it is taking the bread out of their mouths to enter
into combination for any purpose like that described by the <i>Post</i> in
a paragraph announcing:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
&quot;<span class="smcap">Another Social Movement.</span>&mdash;The working-men of the West End have
set on foot a new social movement, the main object of which is to enable them
to hold meetings with their trade and friendly societies away from public-houses.
A body of earnest working-men have been exerting themselves for
some months past to raise funds for the purpose of building a central hall, in
which the trade and friendly societies of Chelsea, Brompton, and Kensington
may meet, instead of at public-houses. There are upwards of seventy such
societies in the districts named.&quot;
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">If working-men generally take to courses like these, they will
very soon vindicate their order from the accusation of drunkenness
which Liquor <span class="smcap">Lawson</span>, <span class="smcap">Dawson Burns</span>, and their followers, put
forward as a pretext for soliciting the whole people to let themselves
be placed under restraint, like idiots or babies. The sober
and earnest working-men, drinking their beer in moderation, will
show themselves to be really the same flesh and blood with the gentlemen
who sip their claret soberly, and are so kind as to interest themselves
in the promotion of schemes for withholding their poorer kind
from indulgence in &quot;intoxicating liquors.&quot; But then the occupation
of the United Kingdom Alliance will be gone. That is to say, they
will be deprived of all excuse for vociferating, plotting, and conspiring
to have the pleasure of regulating the habits of others.</p>

strong internal evidence of the practised pen of <span class="smcap">Professor Porringer</span>.
That on &quot;Extraordinary Ebullitions,&quot; in the <i>Impartialist</i>,
is understood to emanate from <span class="smcap">Dr. Julius Teezer</span>.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Jewini's</span> great classic Opera&mdash;<i>La Vecchia Madre Ubardio</i>&mdash;will
be revived next season at La Scala.</p>

<p class="indent">A new weekly periodical is announced. It will be printed, published,
edited, written, illustrated, stitched, and sold exclusively by
women, and the type, ink, and paper, will be supplied by manufacturers
who employ none but female artificers. Men will not be
allowed to interfere with this journal in any way, except as purchasers.
The title is <i>Superior Wisdom</i>.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Signor Zafferano-Collina</span> has resumed his (open air) Organ

<p class="indent">In the course of the ensuing season, <span class="smcap">Messrs. Brane and Booker</span>
will bring to the hammer the valuable Library formed by the late
<span class="smcap">Jonathan Bell Diver</span>, M.A., F.A.S., F.E.L.S. It is remarkably
rich in nursery rhymes, cookery books, gipsyana, and treatises on
dentistry and fireworks, and includes a unique series of privately
printed publications relating to the County of Rutland.</p>

<p class="indent">The result of more extended investigations goes to prove that the

probably conclude his labours in the Old Kent Road.</p>

which <span class="smcap">Agamemnon</span> is represented as blowing a kiss, across the
Prytaneum, to <span class="smcap">Clytemnestra</span>, who is pacing the Bema, in the
absence of her guardian on a secret expedition. <span class="smcap">Ægisthus</span> appears
in the background, detained by some law business, and the Chorus
is endeavouring to convince him that he is in the wrong. This
powerful painting, with its subtle <i>nuances</i>, its harmonious play of
light and shade, its truthful rendering of the Piraeus, and the
splendid drawing of the Chorus's left leg, will carry conviction to
all who can reverence a conscientious manipulation of another of the
grand old trilogies of the Athenian stage.</p>

<p class="indent">The new metal, Fluozinium, is steadily making its way against
the current of scientific prejudice. It has been discovered in almost
limitless quantities in conjunction with tufa and hæmatite; and
the most delicate persons may inhale its fumes with perfect safety.
In specific gravity Fluozinium is superior both to nickel and cobalt;
it will ignite nowhere but on the box, and not often there; and for
porosity, frangibility, and opalescence, no metal in our time has
approached it.</p>

<p class="indent">The Dryrot Society have at the present time two more volumes of

century; the other, a list of all persons holding <i>in capite</i> a carucate
of land and upwards, who were in fief to the Crown in the
Border Wars. A few copies will be struck off on large paper, and
six on vellum.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">he</span> details supplied by the
newspapers give but an
inadequate idea of the
interesting rites and
ceremonies which cluster
round the election of a
new <span class="smcap">Speaker</span>, and have
been observed, with undeviating
fidelity, since
those early times, when the
original <span class="smcap">Speaker</span> received
the sanction of his Sovereign
under the shade of
the &quot;Parliament Oak&quot; in
&quot;Merry Sherwood.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">From the first moment
that he gets a post-card
informing him he is to be
proposed to the House for
the vacant Chair, the
<span class="smcap">Speaker</span>-designate gives
up the sports of the field,
dinner company, and all
other pleasures and amusements,
and devotes himself,
night and day, to the perusal of the journals of the House of
Commons, the investigation of the Standing Orders, and the study
of the Constitutional History of England, Parliamentary precedents
and privileges, and the Biographies of his predecessors.</p>

<p class="indent">He reads a fixed portion of <i>Hansard</i> every morning and evening.</p>

<p class="indent">He sees no one but the Clerk of the House and his Assistants,
who call to give him daily private tuition.</p>

<p class="indent">He forms a collection of the photographs of all the Members, that
his recognition of them may be immediate and unerring.</p>

<p class="indent">During the week before the meeting of Parliament he visits all his
old haunts for the last time, and takes leave of his friends, with
whom, of course, as First Commoner, he can never again mix on the
same familiar terms.</p>

<p class="indent">The day before his election he has his hair cut.</p>

<p class="indent">On the eve of the great event he retires to rest early, and on the
morning of the most momentous day in his life he rises with the
first streak of dawn in the east, and paces to and fro on Constitution
Hill, to collect his thoughts and prepare his speech.</p>

<p class="indent">The Sergeant-at-Arms conveys him, attired in a full Court suit
to Westminster, in a close carriage, with the blinds drawn down,
and remains with him in a vault in the Victoria Tower, where
he is provided with the daily papers, writing materials, and refreshments,
until his proposer and seconder arrive to conduct him into
the House. (There is a large looking-glass in the vault, before which
he tries on his wig and gown, with the experienced aid of the
Sergeant.)</p>

<p class="indent">The subsequent proceedings are pretty much as the papers have
described them, except that the Proposer and Seconder wear nosegays,
and carry halberds; and that the <span class="smcap">Speaker</span> stands up before he
takes his seat in the chair, which is draped with the Union Jack,
brandishes the Mace (decked with ribbons for the occasion) three
times round his head, and in a loud voice, and in Norman French,
invites the whole of the officers of the House to dine with him that
evening at the Albion at seven.</p>

<h2>INQUESTS QUITE UNNECESSARY.</h2>

<p class="indent">On Thursday last week, at a meeting of the Middlesex
Magistrates:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
&quot;A communication was received from the guardians of the
poor of the parish of St. Pancras, stating that there was an increase
in the number of inquests held upon the bodies of persons
dying in the workhouse, and that a majority of them were unnecessary;
but the guardians were powerless to prevent such
inquests being held, and were of opinion that if the fees receivable
by the medical officers of the workhouses in the metropolis
were abolished, a number of such inquests would no longer be
held.&quot;
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">The insinuation against the metropolitan Poor-Law
medical officers of a charge of obtaining fees under false
pretences, does credit to the shopkeepers in limited lines
of business out of whose inner self-consciousness it
sprang. Of course the inquests held upon many of the
paupers who have died in the St. Pancras Workhouse
have been unnecessary. There, not very much more particularly
than in other workhouses, can the majority of
paupers be supposed to perish from special neglect.
Most of them, no doubt, die of mere misery.</p>

&quot;exhibit&quot; infinitesimal doses. Truly Royal practice of
hom&oelig;opathy.</p>

<hr />

<h2>THE SOUTH KENSINGTON BAZAAR.</h2>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Mr. Punch</span> has seldom been more disgusted&mdash;and that is saying
a good deal in these days&mdash;than by the low, sordid, Philistine,
anticosmopolitan agitation on the subject of the International
Exhibitions.</p>

<p class="indent">He will endeavour to express himself calmly on the topic, but
gives no pledge that he will not be induced to use strong language.</p>

<p class="indent">British manufacturers and vendors complain (he hates people that
complain of anything) that the Foreigner is unduly and unjustly
favoured by the directors of these Exhibitions. &quot;Foreigner!&quot; At
the outset, that word is in itself offensive. All mankind are Brothers,
more or less. But let that pass.</p>

<p class="indent">The Foreigner is allowed to bring to South Kensington whatever
wares he pleases, and to exhibit them to the best advantage at handsome
stalls, for which he pays no rent. To the Exhibition the
British public is invited by every official blandishment&mdash;fête, flower-show,
and music are among the attractions&mdash;and for several months
the very best and most opulent portion of society is thus brought to
be tempted by the Foreigner's productions.</p>

<p class="indent">Furthermore, the Foreigner is allowed to deprive the Exhibition
of its character as an Exhibition, and to make it a shop. For
he may sell anything which he has brought over (whether it be
part of his show, or any other article which it has occurred to him
as likely to be acceptable), and the purchaser may take it away at
once. This is coarsely described as entirely departing from the
theory that it was by the display and comparison of wares that the
interests of Art were to be promoted. It is irreverently urged
that the accomplished Prince who originally devised those Exhibitions
would never have sanctioned their being converted into
Shops and Bazaars.</p>

<p class="indent">The British manufacturers and vendors condescend to urge that
this is not giving them fair play, that the Foreigner is helped in
every way to sell his goods, and that the Briton who pays rent for
his own shop, and heavy taxes for the support of the State, is rendered
all the less able to do so, by reason that custom is drawn away
from him in favour of those who pay neither rent nor taxes.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Mr. Punch</i> regrets to find that Leading Men of business take
these narrow views, and that the representatives of some of the most
eminent firms in England have met under the auspices of the <span class="smcap">Lord
Mayor</span>, also a man of business, to assert that the system is unjust.
It may be thought that when such men deliberately protest against
anything, they may be supposed to have good reasons for their
protest. But this is a commonplace way of thinking.</p>

<p class="indent">Let us try and rise above mere material views, and let the holy
and genial rays of the sun of cosmopolitanism warm up our insular
hearts. All mankind are Brothers, as has been already observed, and
who would grudge his brother anything? Why should the British
person be considered in the matter? Talk of his paying taxes&mdash;well,
he does not like to pay them&mdash;and if he is ruined, he will not be called
upon to pay them any more. That is a detail beneath contempt.
What <i>Mr. Punch</i> is so ashamed of, is the chill and callous British
nature, which refuses to recognise the holiness of universal philanthropy,
and clings to old-fashioned ideas of a man's duty to his own
family and his own nation. The Englishman who could see in the
prosperity of the Rue de Rivoli no compensation for the ruin of
Regent Street, is so low in the scale of civilisation that we blush to
call him countryman.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Mr. Punch</i> has no such sordid feelings, and his noble heart will
leap with generous joy to behold the wealthy pouring out their gold
on the counter or at the stall of his Foreign Brothers at South Kensington,
and if his British Brother is, as he thinks, unfairly used
and impoverished, let him find consolation in the thought that we
are all the same &quot;flesh and blood.&quot; Let him mention this to <span class="smcap">Mr.
Lowe's</span> tax-collector, and it is certain that the latter will, like
<span class="smcap">Sterne's</span> angel, drop a gentle tear on the charge he was going to
make, and blot it out for ever.</p>

<h2>AN OBJECT OF SYMPATHY.</h2>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Can</span> a man murder his wife? The point seems doubtful,
to judge by the common experience of the Courts,
and the general tone of public opinion, when a charge
for this questionable offence is under consideration or
comment. On the whole, it would seem to be desirable
that we should cease to use the term &quot;Murder&quot; of Wife-killing,
and create a special term for that offence&mdash;if
offence it can be called. May we suggest either &quot;Wife-icide,&quot;
or &quot;Spousi-cide,&quot; or &quot;Uxori-cide&quot;? It would
be the correlative, in cases of feminine life-taking, of
&quot;justifiable homicide&quot; in the case of male.</p>

<p class="indent">It was very touching to observe the general expression
of newspaper sympathy with an individual lately convicted
for having pushed a little too far, perhaps, the
natural feeling of exasperation and impatience with a
wife who may safely be assumed to have been a very
aggravating person. &quot;Poor monomaniac,&quot; &quot;unfortunate
gentleman,&quot; and so forth, are terms which
testify to the natural tenderness of the public feeling
towards one who is subjected to such painful consequences
for so venial an act of temporary irritation.</p>

<p class="indent">We are glad to see that this touching and well-directed
sympathy is confined to this unfortunate victim of a
rash impulse. As for the woman who provoked him, we
observe only a considerate silence, or the expression of a
feeling equivalent to the well-known Cornish verdict&mdash;&quot;Sarved
her right.&quot;</p>

<h2>NEWS FROM NAPLES.</h2>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Mr. Punch</span> received a letter stating that in the writer's opinion it
might interest <i>Mr. P.'s</i> readers to know the state of the weather in
Naples. If there be one thing in the world nobody out of Naples
cares one farthing about, <i>Mr. Punch</i> supposes that thing to be
mentioned above. But, <i>respice finem</i>. On examining the report
enclosed by his Correspondent, <i>Mr. Punch</i> discovers that the subject
is very interesting indeed. Here is the faithful reprint of an
official document supplied to the <i>Naples Observer</i>. Emphatically
we call the weather in question queer weather. We omit barometers
and thermometers, and all that stuff.</p>

<h2>Spiritualism for Sailors.</h2>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Mr. Vernon Lushington</span>, Permanent Secretary to the Admiralty,
speaking of that body of naval administrators, doubtless, with
knowledge and in sincerity, calls it a &quot;Phantom Board.&quot; A Board
of Phantoms may be said to be a Board of Ghosts, and such a Board
of Admiralty sending British seamen afloat in rotten <i>Megæras</i>, is a
Board of Ghosts with power to add to their number.</p>

<hr />

<h2>A MODEST DEMAND.</h2>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">The</span> season might be milder&mdash;it could hardly be more malevolent.
But here is mildness:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
A WIDOWER of middle age, of quiet and regular habits, who has
three children at boarding school, desires a HOME in the house of an
independent Christian widow or single lady, whose object in letting apartments
is chiefly society, who would accept merely nominal terms, and where
he would be the only lodger. Nice house and servant desirable.&mdash;Address,
with every particular, &amp;c., &amp;c.
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">What a charming person must this advertiser be, if we may judge
from the high value which he sets on his society! No doubt he has
been deluged with replies to his advertisement. What independent
lady could possibly decline to offer him the home which he so modestly
demands, and to sacrifice her independence by accepting him as
lodger, first, and finally as lord, as soon as he inclined to offer her
his heart? &quot;Beware of widows, <i>Sammy!</i>&quot; said the elder <i>Mr.
Weller</i>. Beware of widowers, ladies! adds the wiser <i>Mr. Punch</i>.</p>

<p class="indent">Throughout the dialogues, there were words used to mimic accents of
the speakers. Those words were retained as-is.</p>

<p class="indent">Errors in punctuations and inconsistent hyphenation were not corrected
unless otherwise noted. For instance, a quotation mark is missing in the
first main paragraph of &quot;Evenings From Home,&quot; and the formatting and spelling of the table under &quot;State of the Weather in Naples from the 6th to the

works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project

creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
